# Cortex

A graphical control interface for Predator's license plate recognition capabilities


## Description

Cortex is a a complete graphical interface capable of controlling all of Predator's (and Predator Fabric's) core ALPR functionality. As such, when Predator is paired with Cortex, the command line becomes unnecessary, and all configuration and system management can be done through a graphical interface. That being said, Cortex is capable of working in tandem with the command line, and each interface method can be used interchangeably without conflict.

Cortex allows the user to start, stop, and configure Predator over a local network, as well as view license plates detected in real-time. Cortex also makes it easy to offload license plate logs for use with other software, like [V0LT Premonition](https://v0lttech.com/premonition.php).

## Compatability

Cortex is compatible both with vanilla [Predator](https://v0lttech.com/predator.php), and [Predator Fabric](https://v0lttech.com/predatorfabric.php). The instance type is identified automatically using the configuration file.


## Features

### Offline

Although Cortex operates over a network, it doesn't require any kind of internet connection to function. This makes it easy to use Cortex on an offline LAN embedded in a vehicle.

### Automatic

Cortex makes it possible to automatically start and stop Predator when the system boots, which makes it an entirely hands-off system. In this case, Cortex can be used as a passive display when desired without having to manually start and stop Predator every time the car starts.

### Easy

First and foremost, Cortex is designed to be easy and user friendly. While it has a wide gamut of capabilities, routine tasks are straight-forward enough for anyone with basic technical knowledge to complete.

### Interchangeable

While a graphical interface is great for simplicity, there's often times that a command line is the more efficient way to do something. As such, Cortex doesn't lock out command line changes, and is capable of being used interchangeably with the command line interface.

### Compatible

Cortex works through nearly any web browser, and doesn't even require JavaScript to function fully. Whether you're using a powerful fully-featured browser, or a minimalist lightweight one, Cortex should work great.
