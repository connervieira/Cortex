# Cortex

A graphical control interface for Predator Fabric.


## Description

Predator Fabric is a heavily modified variant of the base Predator ALPR system, and is intended to be used as a network service in consumer devices. Cortex is a complete graphical interface capable of controlling all of Predator Fabric's core functionality. As such, when Predator Fabric is paired with Cortex, the command line becomes unnecessary, and all configuration and system management can be done through a graphical interface. That being said, Cortex is capable of working in tandem with the command line, and each interface method can be used interchangeably without conflict.


## Features

### Easy

First and foremost, Cortex is designed to be easy and user friendly. While it has a wide gamut of capabilities, routine tasks are straight-forward enough for anyone with basic technical knowledge to complete.

### Interchangeable

While a graphical interface is great for simplicity, there's often times that a command line is the more efficient way to do something. As such, Cortex doesn't lock out command line changes, and is capable of being used interchangeably with the command line.

### Compatible

Cortex works through nearly any web browser, and doesn't even require JavaScript to function fully. Whether you're using a powerful fully-featured browser, or a minimalist lightweight one, Cortex should work great.
